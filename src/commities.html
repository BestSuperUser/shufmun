            UNODC is a global leader in
the fight against illicit drugs and international crime. Established in 1997 through a merger between the United Nations Drug Control Programme and the Centre for International Crime Prevention, UNODC operates in all regions of the world through an extensive network of field offices UNODC is mandated to assist Member States in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime and terrorism. In the Millennium Declaration, Member States also resolved to intensify efforts to fight transnational crime in all its dimensions, to redouble the efforts to implement the commitment to counter the world drug problem and to take concerted action against international terrorism.

Besides the standard approach to the topic, in countries that have a suitable population majority regarding the legalization of drugs under the supervision of the states. Committee members will intensify carrying that topic into their parliament or responsible organ of their countries to get a decision about the issued subject via a referendum.
<div class="py-1"></div>
In case the referendum gets a positive response from the public, advancing strategies will be reorganized according to formerly taken decisions by the UNODC.
On the other hand, countries that do have not such a population will focus on executing the past way of approach regarding the topic. Even though the subject of solutions they will use to solve the problems in different category levels, they will proceed with a behavior which is compromised to the countries that are using the new method. Obliging these manners to their behaviors will eventually provide them with the integrity of opinions about the topic and grant their citizens common sense.

            The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was founded in 1945 as the League of Nations was transforming into the United Nations (UN) of our day.
            <br>
            Coming forward as a new establishment rather than a new organization, the United Nations embraces and authorizes the Security Council as an international organization that primarily aims to protect international peace and security. Examining the operation and the nature of the Security Council, one can see the clear reflections of the aims of the UN, which are listed in Article 1 of the Charter of the UN. The Charter also imposes an obligation or Member States to implement the decisions made by the Security Council, consequently distinguishing the Council from other bodies of the UN, which are only authorized to present suggestions to the Member States. The Security Council gathers its sessions with 15 Members with each member being entitled to one vote for the purposes of decision-making The mentioned members are distinguished in two groups; Permanent Members and Non-Permanent Members. The Permanent Members of the Security Council, also known as the "permanent five" or the "P5", are namely The Republic of China, France, The Russian Federation, The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
            The United States of America. The permanencies of these members derive from decisions taken in the formation process of the fundamentals of the Security Council. The
            fact that these States have also been equipped with a
            right to veto any action taken by the Security Council still maintains its influence on the international community of
            today, since the legal regulations of the authority of P5 remains intact.

            As a result of the 7-day war with Israel in 1967, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) was established as a result of a meeting held in Beirut in January 1968 in order to enable the oil exporting Arab countries to cooperate more closely.
            <br>
            The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) is a multi-governmental organization headquartered in Kuwait which coordinates energy policies among oil-producing Arab nations. OAPEC's primary objective is safeguarding the cooperation of numerous members in various aspects of economic activity within the oil industry as well as maintaining strong relations among themselves; to provide legitimate means to preserve the members' individual and collective efforts within the industry; unite on-going efforts for the procurement of oil; provide access to consumer markets on fair and reasonable terms; and provide conditions, adequate capital, and experience of investors in the oil industry.

            In the United States, a designated survivor (or designated successor) is a named individual in the presidential line of succession, chosen to stay at an undisclosed secure location, away from events such as State of the Union addresses and presidential inaugurations. The practice of designating a successor is intended to prevent a hypothetical decapitation of the government and to safeguard continuity in the office of the president in the event the president along with the vice president and multiple other officials in the presidential line of succession die in a mass-casualty incident. The procedure originated in the 1950s during the Cold War with its risk of nuclear attack.
            <br>
            If such an event occurred, the surviving official highest in the line of succession as delineated in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 would become Acting President of the United States. Consequently, the individual named as a designated survivor must be eligible to serve as president. In practice, the designated survivor is usually a member of the president's Cabinet, and is chosen by the president.
            <br>
            On the night of the State of the Union, an explosion destroys the Capitol Building, killing the President and everyone in the line of succession except for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Thomas Kirkman, who had been named the designated survivor. Kirkman is immediately sworn in, unaware that the attack is just the beginning of what is to come. He faces many challenges throughout the series, struggling to balance his political aspirations with the challenge of being seen as a legitimate president.
